DevTools SmartDriver is a Selenium & Appium SDK that makes it easy to write robust cross-device app tests backed by computer vision and artificial intelligence.

SmartDriver integrates seamelessly with your existing tests, and will act as backup if your selectors break/fail by attempting to visually (computer vision) identify elements.

SmartDriver is able to accomplish this by automatically ingesting your appium elements (using both screenshots and element names) when you run your test cases with dev-tools.ai for the first time.

The SDK is accompanied by a [web-based editor](https://smartdriver.dev-tools.ai/) which makes building visual test cases easy; you can draw boxes around your elements instead of using fragile CSS or XPath selectors.

## Install
In your terminal, run

```bash
pip install devtools-ai
```
