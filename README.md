The dev-tools.ai SmartDriver SDK is a simple library that makes it easy to write robust tests backed by computer vision and artificial intelligence.

dev-tools.ai integrates seamelessly with your existing tests, and will act as backup if your selectors break/fail by attempting to visually (computer vision) identify elements.

The dev-tools.ai SDK is able to accomplish this by automatically ingesting your elements (using both screenshots and element names) when you run your test cases with dev-tools.ai for the first time. 

The SDK is accompanied by a [web-based editor](https://sdk.dev-tools.ai/) which makes building visual test cases easy; you can draw boxes around your elements instead of using fragile CSS or XPath selectors.

## Install
In your terminal, run

```bash
pip install devtools-ai
```
